# Karyinon: Longread Karyon

Karyon is a package that assesses the ploidy of a library, reads or contigs.

I aim to adapt the karyon workflow to use long reads and detect ploidy artifacts in our assemblies.

This workflow will include assembly appraisal with QUAST and Merqury, mitochondrial and contaminant 
read identification with Blobtools, and detect homeologous contigs using Nucmer and LastZ.
