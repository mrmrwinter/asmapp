# Use cases

#### A series of use cases for ASMAPP

## Case 1: De novo assembly of non-model organisms
When performing a de novo assembly of a non-model species it is necessary to generate many draft assemblies in the process of finding the most appropriate assembler for the genome. Using ASMAPP, each of these can be appraised quickly and reproducibly in a standardised and comparable way.

## Case 2: Reference assembly of a model species
Before starting any kind of analysis that is dependant on a reference genome, it is good practice to first assess and generate descriptive statistics of the reference.


## Case 3: Assessing quality of an existing assembly before analysis
If you need to use a reference assembly as part of your analysis, you would often download it from GenBank, but how do you know the quality of the assembly you are getting? 

## Case 4: Comparative genomics
ASMAPP can be used to generate data and statistics in a reproducible and standardised way. This can allow comparison of genomes in a controlled manner.
