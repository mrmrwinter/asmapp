# Notes on installation

## MINICONDA

This workflow requires miniconda. Miniconda can be downloaded here: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

<br>

## BLOBPLOTS

Blobplots requires some databases installed locally in order to perform a taxonomy lookup.

I will add a setting in the config to path to a locally installed blast database, as well as instructions on how to install one, here, but I'll also add a rule to install the blast database if none is present.

### BLAST database install instructions

 setup
 requires that the ncbi database is installed and configured in the config files
 needs taxdumpdownloading and unpacking in the same folder as the nt database
