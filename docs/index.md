# ASMAPP v0.9
#### AsSeMbly APPraisal workflow

_________________________________________________


#### About
ASMAPP is a reproducible workflow designed to run many common tasks for the appraisal of genome assemblies. It does this by bringing together several open source programs into a single snakemake-based workflow, automating many otherwise semi-intensive tasks.

_________________________________________________


__The workflow currently includes rules for the following analyses:__  
- Read mapping  
- Assembly appraisal statistics  
- Mitochondrial contig flagging/removal  
- Contaminant identification  
- Variant calling  
- Mapping statistic generation  
- Ploidy estimations  
- Coverage analytics  
- Homoeologous contig detection\*  
- Comparative homoeolog statistics\*
